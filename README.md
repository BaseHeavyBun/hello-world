Yep, I'm a n00b. Getting my feet wet. Will use as junk drawer, inevitably.
oh, clever. at the end of the edit, I can decide to commit to the branch I just chose (created in this case) or create an entirely *new* branch and make a pull request - mmm, unlimited line length. nix. nice. what's the editor escape charactor so I can use asterisk singular? - if it deserves a new branch of its own.
